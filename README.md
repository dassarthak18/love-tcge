# The LÖVE2D Card Games Engine

This is a game engine written in Lua (LÖVE2D) for designing and playing card games over the internet using the standard 52-card French deck, or its derivatives. Card games can be saved, loaded and shared as JSON files. Think of it as Gary's mod -- but for playing cards.
